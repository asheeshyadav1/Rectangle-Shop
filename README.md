In this Github Repo exists my ASN #2 for CMPT 276. Here I have used Spring boot webframe to host the (mock)compnay "Rectangle Innovation" on render. This is a full stack web application to a database in psql where it retrieves, delete, displays, and adds rectangles. 

NOTE: I did use Github Copilot to help me create company messages and slogans, in addition to it helping me bugs and help in css design to propely capture my vision of the web app.
