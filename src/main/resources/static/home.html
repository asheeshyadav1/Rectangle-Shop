    <!-- UI MOCKUP: The website has a simple design with top and bottom banners for consistent formatting.
        There are three tabs on the top left for navigating to the home, about us, and products pages.
        The banners remain on all pages to facilitate easy navigation.

        To add a rectangle, users go to add.html, submit the form, and the data is sent to /users/add, 
        where it's stored in the database. A display page confirms the addition, and users are redirected 
        to the view/add page to see or create rectangles.

        For viewing or editing rectangles, users navigate via /users/product. Clicking a link or button 
        sends a request to the controller, which returns the rectangle's attributes or processes edits. 
        After editing, users see a confirmation page and are redirected back to view the rectangles.

        Deleting a rectangle works similarly: the delete button sends a request to the controller, 
        confirms deletion, and redirects users to the view/add page.

        The home, about us, and products banners are consistent across all pages for easy navigation. 
        For detailed endpoint information, refer to the usersController.java file. -->
